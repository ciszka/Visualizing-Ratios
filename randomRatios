#This function was developed to explore visualization for bias watch archaeo data
#but may be used for any data that invovles visualizing ratios
#It creates ratios of "male" to "female" speakers by randomizing the number of
#Each type of speaker for each "session"
#there can be a maximum of 20 speakers within one session

randomRatios = function(NumberOfSessions){ #tells it how many "session" to create pairs for

#Generates the base data for the ratios
  female = sample(0:10, 10, size =NumberOfSessions) #Generates the amount of female speakers per session
  male = sample(0:10, 10, size = NumberOfSessions) #Generates the amount of male speakers per session

#Plots the "sessions" as points visualizing the ones with more males as red and those with more women as green
#This is just a simple scatter plot and maybe be useful for instances where there are few sessions and
#the ratio comparison is pretty different for each of them, This is good for generally visualizing the
#ratios, plotting one variable against the other, however, it can saturate quickly so large datasets
#Will not find this technique useful
  plot(female, male, col = ifelse(female < male,'red','green'))

#The next section adds lines to account for different ratio extremes
  abline(a = 0, b =1, col = "blue") #Gender parity (sort of what we hope for) this is a general guideline, could be any hoped for ratio
  
     #The below not used portion would add line for each match up of ratios
     #May be useful for visualization but for now it's probably more difficult to interpret
     #too many lines generally
     #for (i in 1:NumberOfSessions) {
     #  if (male[i] == 0 || female[i] == 0){
     #    
     #  } else {
     #  abline(a = 0, b = male[i]/female[i])
     #  }
     #}
    
  #This line is the NSF ratio for the number of men: women, adds the line for what the
  #the population ideal is, above is too many men in relation to the NSF baseline ratio
  #This line was specific for the NSF ratio, any ratio line that is the chosen appropriate
  #ratio that we are looking for can be included here
  #Essentially above the line = more of the Y value (in this case males per session)
  #below th eline = more of hte x value (in this case women per session)
  abline(a =0, b = .53)

  
  #This line is the WORST possible outcome, aka ALL DUDES IN A SESSION
  #The number of points on this line indicates how many sessions are really
  #Doing a bad job incorporating women into their discussions
  #Or whatever your Y value is 
  abline(v = 0, col = "red")
  
  #This line is sort of the "best" possible outcome, aka ALL LADIES IN A SESSION
  #The number of points on this line indicates how many session are really
  #Doing a good job of incorporating women into their discussions
  #Or whatever you X value is 
  abline(h = 0, col = "green")
  
  #The log of the ratio is an alternative and interesting way to visualize this data as well
  #the log of the ratio essentially makes it so that 1/10 and 10/1 mirror one another
  #The only problem with this is that 0/10 (which would be an all male panel and 10/0 an
  #All female panel have funny values, also the interpretation of the actual log value
  #Is not super intuitive but I think it gives a more genuine depiction of the spread
  #Than the straight histogram and gives a better sense of frequnecy than the 
  #X-Y plot on it's own
  #The histogram looking at the log of the ratios is a better way to visualize the data
  #It captures the number of sessionw ith a particular ratio and while the axis might
  #not mean anything for people, the visual image is more understandable
  #The only problems, as listed above are the x/0 and 0/x cases
  hist(log(female/male), breaks =10)
  print(log(male/female))
