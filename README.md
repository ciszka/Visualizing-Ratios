# Visualizing-Ratios
I was interested in exploring how to visualize data converted into ratios. Because of the nature of ratios, assuming one keeps the denominator and numerator the same as one gets larger than the other, you may have as much variation between 0-1 and 1-infinity meaning that traditional visualization schemes such as histograms will obscure large amounts of visualization.
